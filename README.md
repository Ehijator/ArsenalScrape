This project will be analysing historical data accquired from [FBREF](https://fbref.com/en/squads/18bb7c10/history/Arsenal-Stats-and-History#all_comps_fa_club_league)
it will be accquire sports historical data on my favorite football team *ARSENAL FC*

# Why embark on this?

There has been a lot of changes in the club in terms of their records over the season in terms of win/losses and placements so an analysis on the data (refreshed daily) would give more insight

# How will this be done

- *Python (Selenium, Pandas)*:
I will be using selenium's capabilities to automate the browser navigation to where my data is and scraping it, then store data in a dataframe and finally exporting it into a csv

- *PowerBI (& Power Query)*:
This is where the analytics front end will be done, hence visualising the data after some transformations.

# Finally...

This will be updated with a demo when a working version is produced.
